About RobotPy
===============

`RobotPy`_ is a distribution of `Python`_ intended to be used for the `FIRST
Robotics Competition`_.  Teams can use this to write their robot code in
Python, a powerful dynamic programming language.

.. _RobotPy: http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/projects/robotpy
.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _FIRST Robotics Competition: http://www.usfirst.org/

Features
==========

*  `Python`_ is simple to learn and easy to maintain.
*  RobotPy lets you reload code without restarting.
*  RobotPy provides access to the WPILib class library.
*  You don't need to use WindRiver (unless you're rebuilding RobotPy itself).

Installation for most people
============================

Download the binary releases from our FIRSTForge site, unpack them, and run
install.py. Download from: http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/projects/robotpy


Installation from Source using our build VM 
===========================================

Using the provided build virtual machine is the easiest way to build RobotPy
from source. See build-vm/README.txt for instructions.


Installation from Source (Advanced Users Only)
==============================================

Step 1: Install Python 

    Python 2.7.5 is known to work. Ensure that you add your python installation
    directory to your PATH variable.
    
    Note: This step is required for SIP installation

Step 2: Install SIP v4.15.3:

	The cmake build process currently checks for exact versions of SIP, as
	the generated code changes from release to release.

    http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/sip4/installation.html

    Note: Installation of SIP on Windows requires Visual Studio or MinGW
    installed, see the SIP build instructions for more details.
    
Step 3: Build the source tree

	TODO: Update these instructions for Windows too?
	

	The RobotPy build process uses cmake to build the RobotPy distribution.
	frcmake is a wrapper around cmake that sets the build environment up to
	build for the cRio.
	
	A Vagrant-based VM is available that you can use to install the needed gcc
	build environment and frcmake scripts. See the following URL:
	
		https://github.com/virtuald/frc-gcc-vm.git 
		
	Create a directory (the 'binary directory') outside of the RobotPy source 
	tree, and run this:
	
		$ frcmake /path/to/robotpy
		
	Once you've done this, you can build the code:
	
		$ make
		
	To copy the build output to the 'dist' directory, run this command from
	your binary directory:
	
		$ make install
	
	To build a binary release, just run the following command and a zip file
	will be created in your build directory.
	
		$ make package
    
Step 4: Robot Installation
    
    From the 'dist' directory inside of your binary directory, run install.py
    
    Alternatively, you can FTP the contents of the 'robot' directory to your
    cRio directly. However, install.py is easier.

Technical Overview
====================

RobotPy is a packaging of a patched `Python`_ 3.2 interpreter (found in the
``RobotPy/Python`` subdirectory of the source code).  All access to the WPILib
is generated by a `SIP`_ interface, which is found in ``Packages/wpilib/sip/``.
When the robot is started, it initializes the Python interpreter and runs the
file ``py/boot.py``.  From there, all responsibility is given to the
``boot.py`` script, which is referred to as the bootloader.

If ``boot.py`` ever exits (due to an exception, for example), the C++ code
exits.  The default ``boot.py`` simply exits on any user exception.  If this
happens, you can reboot easily via NetConsole by simply typing "reboot"
followed by hitting the enter key.  This is how code reloads are performed.
As boot.py is written in Python, this behavior can be customized as desired.

Major Differences from standard Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Several Python modules with large and/or incompatible dependencies removed,
   namely: curses, dbm, gdbm, tkinter, nis, ossaudiodev, resource, spwd,
   syslog, termios, audioop, bz2, crypt, grp, ssl, pwd, and mmap.

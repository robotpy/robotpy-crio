About RobotPy
===============

`RobotPy`_ is a distribution of `Python`_ intended to be used for the `FIRST
Robotics Competition`_.  Teams can use this to write their robot code in
Python, a powerful dynamic programming language.

Installation
==============

Unzip the release .zip to a temporary directory.

The preferred installation method is to run install.py.  This requires a local
(Windows) installation of Python.

Alternatively, you can use any FTP client (e.g. FileZilla) to install.  Connect
to your robot's IP with an FTP client (e.g. ``ftp://10.XX.YY.2/``, where XXYY
is your team number).  Copy all files and directories in the distribution's
``robot`` directory to the root (top level) directory on the robot.
